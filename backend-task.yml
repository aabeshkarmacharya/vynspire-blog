Objective:
    Build a simple Blog Application with user registration, login, and post management. Backend
    should expose a REST API with JWT-based authentication. Frontend should include pages to
    view, create, edit, and delete posts, using state management and authentication.
Backend:
    Tech:
        - Django (without DRF)
        - pyjwt for JWT handling
Requirements:
  Models:
    - User: Extend Django’s AbstractUser if needed.
    - Post:
      - title: CharField
      - content: TextField
      - author: FK to User
      - created_at: DateTimeField (auto_now_add=True)
  Endpoints:
    Register:
      method: POST
      endpoint: /register/
      description: Register a new user
      auth: Public
    Login:
      method: POST
      endpoint: /login/
      description: Return JWT for valid credentials
      auth: Public
    Get-Posts:
      method: GET
      endpoint: /posts/
      description: Get all posts
      auth: Public
    Get-Post:
      method: GET
      endpoint: /posts/<id>
      description: Get post details
      auth: Public
    Create-Post:
      method: POST
      endpoint: /posts/
      description: Create new post
      auth: Authenticated
    Edit-Post:
      method: PUT
      endpoint: /posts/<id>
      description: Edit a post (only author)
      auth: Authenticated
    Delete-Post:
      method: DELETE
      endpoint: /posts/<id>
      description: Delete a post (only author)
      auth: Authenticated

  JWT Auth Requirements:
    - Implement custom JWT auth using pyjwt
    - Store token in "Authorization: Bearer <token>"
    - Token expiry: 1 hour
  Custom Middleware:
    - Log every request method, path, and time taken in ms.
  Error Handling:
    - 401 for expired/invalid token
    - 403 for unauthorized action (e.g. editing others' posts)
    - 404 for not found

Bonus Requirements:
  - Token refresh logic
  - Pagination for posts
  - Dockerization
  - Unit tests
